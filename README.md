# Things to Consider When Reading These 💎

- I try to comment things as clear as I can, so that you can understand them if you need to
- While learning C++, I'm also practising a new writing style that I have somehow invented, [Semicolon First](#semicolon-first)
- Notes and comments might be wrong, as I write them as I learn them and there's no prior knowledge about them!

## Semicolon First
- I'm a fan of _comma first_ style, read about it [here](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/rules/comma-style#first)
- So I thought to myself, why not __Semicolon First__ ?!
- Here I decided to put it into practice
- I will write an article about it in the future, and the link will be shared here
- If you have any comments about it, message me [here](mailto:lenesis@proton.me)

> I hereby annouce the end of ***Semicolon-First*** style practice
> So far I've done 23 scriptings using it, I liked it, but I just
> can't keep it going, people are going to suffer from it, I know that 😂
> I'll write the article about such practice, as promised in README
> If you didn't like it, Thanks for your suffering! But if you did,
> I'm glad you enjoyed it. Have fun coding 💎
