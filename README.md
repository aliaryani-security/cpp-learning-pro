# Things to Consider When Reading These ðŸ’Ž

- I try to comment things as clear as I can, so that you can understand them if you need to
- While learning C++, I'm also practising a new writing style that I have somehow invented, [Semicolon First](#semicolon-first)
- Notes and comments might be wrong, as I write them as I learn them and there's no prior knowledge about them!

## Semicolon First
- I'm a fan of _comma first_ style, read about it [here](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/rules/comma-style#first)
- So I thought to myself, why not __Semicolon First__ ?!
- Here I decided to put it into practice
- I will write an article about it in the future, and the link will be shared here
- If you have any comments about it, message me [here](mailto:lenesis@proton.me)
